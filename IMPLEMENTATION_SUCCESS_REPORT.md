### 4. **Enhanced Main Application** ✅
**File:** `app/main.py`
- ✅ Added database health check endpoint (`/api/v6/db-health`)
- ✅ Enhanced startup event with database connection validation
- ✅ Improved error handling for Redis connectivity

### 5. **Enhanced Admin Routes** ✅
**File:** `app/api/routes/admin.py`
